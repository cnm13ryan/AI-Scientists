## FunctionDef run_experiment(folder_name, run_num, timeout)
**run_experiment**: This function executes a specified experiment within a given directory, handles potential errors, and prepares a prompt for subsequent actions based on the outcome of the experiment.

parameters:
· folder_name: A string representing the path to the directory where the experiment files are located.
· run_num: An integer indicating the current run number of the experiment.
· timeout: An optional integer parameter specifying the maximum time (in seconds) that the experiment is allowed to run before being terminated. The default value is 7200 seconds.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by determining the absolute path of the specified folder_name using `osp.abspath`. It then copies the 'experiment.py' file within this directory to a new file named 'run_{run_num}.py', where {run_num} is replaced with the current run number. This step ensures that each experiment run has its own script, which can be useful for debugging and record-keeping.

Next, it constructs a command list intended to execute the copied script using Python, specifying an output directory named 'run_{run_num}'. The function then attempts to run this command within the specified folder_name directory. It captures any standard error output and checks if the process completes successfully by examining the return code of the subprocess.

If there is an error (non-zero return code), the function prints the error message, removes the created output directory if it exists, and prepares a prompt detailing the failure along with the error message. If the experiment times out, similar actions are taken, including removing the output directory and preparing a timeout-specific prompt.

In case of successful execution (zero return code), the function reads a 'final_info.json' file from the output directory to extract results. It processes these results by extracting only the mean values for each key in the JSON data. The function then prepares a detailed success prompt that includes the experiment results and instructions on how to proceed with further experiments or conclude if all runs are completed.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called within a loop, where it is executed multiple times with incrementing run numbers until either all experiments are completed successfully or a maximum number of iterations is reached. It plays a crucial role in automating the execution and evaluation of experiments, handling errors gracefully, and providing clear instructions for subsequent steps.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
For a successful experiment:
(0, "Run 1 completed. Here are the results:\n{'metric1': 0.85, 'metric2': 0.92}\nDecide if you need to re-plan your experiments given the result (you often will not need to).\nSomeone else will be using `notes.txt` to perform a writeup on this in the future.\nPlease include *all* relevant information for the writeup on Run 1, including an experiment description and the run number. Be as verbose as necessary.\nThen, implement the next thing on your list.\nWe will then run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_2'.\nYOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.\nIf you are finished with experiments, respond with 'ALL_COMPLETED'.")

For a failed experiment:
(1, "Run 1 failed with the following error ...Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"experiment.py\", line 42, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"experiment.py\", line 38, in main\n    raise ValueError('An unexpected error occurred')\nValueError: An unexpected error occurred")
## FunctionDef run_plotting(folder_name, timeout)
**run_plotting**: This function executes a plotting script located in a specified folder and handles potential errors or timeouts during its execution.

parameters:
· folder_name: A string representing the path to the directory containing the `plot.py` script.
· timeout: An integer specifying the maximum number of seconds to wait for the plotting process to complete. The default value is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by obtaining the absolute path of the provided folder name using `osp.abspath(folder_name)`. It then constructs a command list intended to run `plot.py` using Python.

A try-except block is used to manage subprocess execution. The `subprocess.run()` method is called with the constructed command, setting the current working directory (`cwd`) to the specified folder and capturing standard error output (`stderr`). The `text=True` argument ensures that the captured stderr is returned as a string rather than bytes.

If there is any content in `result.stderr`, it gets printed to the standard error stream. If the subprocess returns a non-zero exit code, indicating an error, a message detailing the failure and the return code is printed. The function then prepares a `next_prompt` with the error details for further processing or logging.

In case of successful execution (return code 0), `next_prompt` remains empty. Regardless of success or failure, the function returns a tuple containing the subprocess's return code and the `next_prompt`.

If the plotting process exceeds the specified timeout duration, a `TimeoutExpired` exception is caught. A message indicating the timeout is printed, and the function returns with a return code of 1 and a corresponding `next_prompt`.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used in scenarios where automated plotting scripts need to be executed as part of a larger workflow, such as generating visualizations for experimental results or data analysis. It provides error handling and timeout management, making it robust for integration into more complex systems.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
A successful execution might result in:
(0, '')

An unsuccessful execution due to an error within `plot.py` could yield:
(1, 'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "plot.py", line 34, in <module>\n    main()\n  File "plot.py", line 28, in main\n    data = load_data(args.data_file)\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: \'data.csv\'')

A timeout scenario could produce:
(1, 'Plotting timed out after 600 seconds')
