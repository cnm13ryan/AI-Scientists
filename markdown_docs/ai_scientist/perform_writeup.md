## FunctionDef compile_latex(cwd, pdf_file, timeout)
**compile_latex**: This function compiles a LaTeX document located at 'template.tex' within a specified working directory (cwd) and generates a PDF file, which is then moved to a user-defined location.

**parameters**:
· cwd: A string representing the current working directory where the LaTeX compilation commands will be executed. This directory should contain the 'template.tex' file.
· pdf_file: A string specifying the full path where the compiled PDF file should be saved after successful generation.
· timeout: An integer indicating the maximum time (in seconds) to wait for each command execution before timing out. The default value is 30 seconds.

**Code Description**: The function begins by printing "GENERATING LATEX" to indicate the start of the LaTeX compilation process. It then defines a list of commands necessary for compiling a LaTeX document with bibliography support. These commands include running 'pdflatex' in non-stop mode, which prevents the process from halting on errors, and 'bibtex', which processes the bibliography file.

The function iterates over each command in the defined list, executing them using subprocess.run(). This method allows for capturing both standard output and error messages. If a command execution exceeds the specified timeout, a TimeoutExpired exception is caught, and an appropriate message is printed. Similarly, if a command fails to execute successfully (i.e., returns a non-zero exit code), a CalledProcessError is caught, and an error message is displayed.

After all commands have been executed, the function attempts to move the generated PDF file ('template.pdf') from the working directory to the location specified by 'pdf_file'. If this operation fails due to the absence of the PDF file (e.g., if LaTeX compilation was unsuccessful), a FileNotFoundError is caught and an error message is printed.

**Note**: Usage points include ensuring that the working directory contains all necessary files ('template.tex', bibliography files, images referenced in the document) before calling compile_latex. Developers should also verify that 'pdflatex' and 'bibtex' are installed on their system and accessible from the command line. The function is typically called by higher-level functions like generate_latex, which prepare the LaTeX environment and handle error correction processes before invoking compile_latex to finalize document generation.
