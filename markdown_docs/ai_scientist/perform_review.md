## FunctionDef load_paper(pdf_path, num_pages, min_size)
**load_paper**: This function loads text content from a PDF file, converting it into markdown format if possible. It handles multiple fallback mechanisms to extract text if initial methods fail.

parameters:
· pdf_path: A string representing the file path to the PDF document.
· num_pages: An optional integer specifying the number of pages to read from the PDF. If None, all pages are read.
· min_size: An integer indicating the minimum acceptable length of the extracted text. If the extracted text is shorter than this value, an exception is raised.

Code Description: The function attempts to load and convert a specified PDF file into markdown format using the pymupdf4llm library. If num_pages is not specified, it converts all pages; otherwise, it converts up to the number of pages indicated by num_pages. If the length of the extracted text is less than min_size, an exception is raised.

If pymupdf4llm fails, the function falls back to using pymupdf to extract text from the PDF. It again checks if the extracted text meets the minimum size requirement and raises an exception if not.

As a final fallback mechanism, if both pymupdf4llm and pymupdf fail, the function uses pypdf to extract text. The same check for minimum text length is performed before returning the extracted text.

Note: This function is crucial for extracting readable text from PDF documents in various formats, ensuring that the text meets a minimum quality threshold by checking its length. It is used in scenarios where document review or analysis is required, such as in academic paper reviews or content summarization tasks.

Output Example: 
"Introduction\nThis paper explores the advancements in machine learning techniques...\n\nRelated Work\nPrevious studies have shown that...\n\nMethodology\nOur approach involves training a deep neural network on...\n\nResults\nExperiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy...\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, our findings suggest that..."
## FunctionDef load_review(path)
**load_review**: This function loads a review from a specified JSON file path and returns the content of the "review" key.

parameters:
· path: A string representing the file path to the JSON file containing the review data.

Code Description: The function opens the JSON file located at the given path in read mode. It then uses the `json.load` method to parse the JSON file into a Python dictionary. After parsing, it accesses the value associated with the key "review" and returns this value, which is expected to be the text of the review.

Note: The function assumes that the JSON file at the specified path contains a key named "review". If the file does not exist or if the key is missing, the function will raise an error. This function is typically used in conjunction with other functions that require review data, such as `get_review_fewshot_examples`, which constructs prompts for few-shot learning by incorporating sample reviews.

Output Example: Assuming the JSON file at the specified path contains the following content:
```
{
    "review": "The paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in large datasets. The methodology is sound and the results are promising.",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "date": "2023-10-05"
}
```
The function call `load_review("path/to/review.json")` would return:
"The paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in large datasets. The methodology is sound and the results are promising."
## FunctionDef get_review_fewshot_examples(num_fs_examples)
**get_review_fewshot_examples**: This function constructs a few-shot learning prompt by incorporating sample reviews from previous machine learning conferences. It gathers text content from specified PDF papers and corresponding review texts, formatting them into a structured prompt that can be used to train or evaluate models.

parameters:
· num_fs_examples: An integer specifying the number of sample paper-review pairs to include in the few-shot prompt. The default value is 1.

Code Description: The function initializes a string variable `fewshot_prompt` with an introductory message explaining its purpose and structure. It then iterates over a predefined list of paper and review file paths, up to the count specified by `num_fs_examples`. For each pair, it checks if a text version of the paper exists; if not, it calls `load_paper` to extract text from the PDF. The function retrieves the corresponding review text using `load_review`. Both the paper and review texts are appended to `fewshot_prompt` in a structured format, enclosed within code blocks for clarity.

Note: This function is essential for creating training or evaluation prompts that include examples of well-structured reviews. It leverages existing sample data to provide context and structure for models learning to write reviews.

Output Example: 
Below are some sample reviews, copied from previous machine learning conferences.
Note that while each review is formatted differently according to each reviewer's style, the reviews are well-structured and therefore easy to navigate.

Paper:

```
Introduction
This paper explores the advancements in machine learning techniques...
Related Work
Previous studies have shown that...
Methodology
Our approach involves training a deep neural network on...
Results
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy...
Conclusion
In summary, our findings suggest that...
```

Review:

```
The paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in large datasets. The methodology is sound and the results are promising.

## FunctionDef perform_improvement(review, coder)
**perform_improvement**: This function takes a review of a research paper and a coder object to generate an improved version of the text based on the feedback provided in the review.

parameters:
· review: A string or JSON-serializable object containing the review comments for the research paper.
· coder: An instance of a Coder class that is responsible for processing the improvement prompt and generating the revised text.

Code Description: The function constructs an improvement_prompt by embedding the review into a predefined template. This template instructs the coder to improve the text using the provided review. The review is formatted as a JSON string to ensure it is correctly embedded within the prompt. After constructing the prompt, the function calls the run method of the coder object, passing in the improvement_prompt. This triggers the coding process where the coder generates an improved version of the research paper based on the feedback contained in the review.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the review parameter contains meaningful and actionable feedback for the text to be improved. The coder object should be properly initialized with the necessary models and configurations before calling this function. This function is typically used as part of a larger workflow where a research paper is reviewed, and then improvements are suggested based on the review comments.
